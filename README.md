# LorisSettingsManager

Loris Settings Manager is an extension for the Unity3D game engine designed to make managing game settings easy and straightforward for developers. It allows settings to be configured and in-game menus to be built without writing a single line of code. It also supports writing easy extensions to support custom GUI inputs (either from the asset store or homemade).
