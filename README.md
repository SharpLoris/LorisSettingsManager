# LorisSettingsManager

## Description
Loris Settings Manager is an extension for the Unity3D game engine designed to make managing game settings easy and straightforward for developers. It allows settings to be configured and in-game menus to be built without writing a single line of code. It also supports writing easy extensions to support custom GUI inputs (either from the asset store or homemade).

This repo contains a [React](https://reactjs.org/) site based on [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/). It is the source for the public facing documentation for the Loris Settings Manager project. This repo is open source and deployed automatically to GitHub pages via CircleCI when a commit is made to master.
