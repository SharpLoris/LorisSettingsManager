As of today, the Loris Settings Manager is approved and available on the [Unity Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/loris-settings-manager-139326). I'm really glad to be able to share the last 6 months of work with my fellow developers, and I'm hoping that there are people out there who will find this useful. As I mentioned in my previous post, I have lots of improvements and additions that I'd like to make, but it's hard to be objective about their importance until other people have their hands on it, so hopefully I'll get lots of valuable feedback.

Some thoughts:

#### Free Licenses
I'm looking for ~5 people for now who are interested to receive a license for free. I'm very aware that a package with no user reviews is a risky proposition for a lot of people, so I'm willing to give away some copies in exchange for some reviews. I want to be clear that I'm not asking for shill reviews, all I want is your honest thoughts! At the same time, any feedback you can provide me based on your experiences is extremely valuable. If you're interested in a free license, please email me at [contact@sharploris.net](mailto:contact@sharploris.net).

#### The Price
I've priced it at $60 US dollars to begin with. This seems to be roughly in line with what similar packages cost on the Asset Store, and Unity themselves suggest that the best selling packages are actually in the $50+ bracket. I'm open to feedback on this.

#### The Documentation
At the moment the documentation consists of two pages, as well as an end to end [tutorial video](https://youtu.be/rBYJuimt7DQ) showing how to use Loris Settings Manager in 10 minutes. I am going to be adding more documentation, guides and videos as I go - if you would like to see a guide on something in particular, please let me know.

As always, you can provide feedback on anything here by using the feedback form on this site!
